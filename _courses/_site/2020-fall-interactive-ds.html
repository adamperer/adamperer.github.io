<p><a href="https://cmu-ids-2020.github.io/">Overview of final projects</a></p>

<p>The goal of this course is to provide you with the tools to understand data and build data-driven interactive systems. You will learn to tell a story with the data and explore opportunities enabled by interactive data analysis through a combination of lectures, readings of current literature, and practical skills development. Over the course of the semester, you will learn about data science and the entire data pipeline from collecting and analyzing to interacting with data. We will also cover human-centered aspects of data science and how HCI methods can enhance the interpretation of data. This course requires comfort with programming, as required projects make use of Python and Git (and if you want JavaScript or others). A series of homework assignments help to lay the groundwork for a final larger group project.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>The class will involve programming and debugging. However, you should not take the course if you find programming or debugging extremely difficult because you will have to master several very different programming languages/concepts in very short order (projects make use use of web programming frameworks including Pandas, Altair, <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a>; and multiple languages including Python, JavaScript, and SQL). That being said, the assignments will mostly require Python unless you decide on a project using any other
language.</p>

<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>

<p>The course is project oriented. It includes a large final group-defined project along with 3 homework assignments designed to provide the stepping stones needed to complete the final project. Tentative due dates for these projects can be found at the bottom of this syllabus under the ‘Course Summary’ heading. Your work will be evaluated relative to your background and level of effort. This is a graduate class, and the assumption is that you are a mature and motivated student, and that you will define your work so that you learn and grow, given your background. Students who are taking this course as a part of a technical requirement (such as the computer science course requirement in the HCI PhD) will need to do more advanced or ambitious projects, and should consult with the instructor to make sure they are meeting this bar.</p>

<p>All homework assignments are to be done as individual work. It is expected that students may assist each other with conceptual issues, but not provide code. If you use example code, you must explicitly acknowledge this in your assignment submission. If you are unsure about these boundaries, ask.</p>

<h3 id="work-required">Work Required</h3>

<p>This will not be an exam-heavy course. Instead, much of the work will focus on projects. The course will focus on understanding the techniques of data science and visualization through developing creative analyses and visualizations using tools to solve defined problems.</p>

<p>There is no final exam in this course. Students who do well will be invited to continue on an independent project on topics related to the course, working with Prof. Perer or Prof. Moritz during a future semester.</p>

<h3 id="course-material">Course Material</h3>

<p>Readings will be made available on this CMU Canvas site.</p>

<h3 id="readings">Readings</h3>

<p>You will be expected to read assigned readings before the lecture they pertain to. These may include chapters drawn from textbooks about data, or readings about the research literature. To incentivize this, each student will be required to make at least one relevant postings to the discussion group before the class on which each reading is due. This participation will count toward the Participation and Attendance portion of their grade.</p>

<p>All students are required to submit at least 1 substantive discussion post per week on Piazza related to the course readings. Each student has 1 pass for skipping comments.</p>

<p>Good comments typically exhibit one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Critiques of arguments made in the papers</li>
  <li>Analysis of implications or future directions for work discussed in lecture or readings</li>
  <li>Clarification of some point or detail presented in the class</li>
  <li>Insightful questions about the readings or answers to other people’s questions</li>
  <li>Links to web resources or examples that pertain to a lecture or reading</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="grades">Grades</h3>

<p>The tentative breakdown for grading is below. As a reminder, here is the <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/AcademicIntegrity.htm">university policy on academic integrity</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>40% Homework Assignments</li>
