description: "Email, while often considered personal and private, is also a rich source of social data. Over time, people accumulate extensive email repositories that contain detailed information about their personal communication patterns and relationships. My prior research focused on building visualizations that capture hierarchical, correlational, and temporal patterns present in email repositories."
