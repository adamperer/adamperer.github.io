description: "As datasets grow and analytic algorithms become more complex, the typical workflow of analysts launching an analytic, waiting for it to complete, inspecting the results, and then re-launching the computation with adjusted parameters is not realistic for many real-world tasks. We present an alternative workflow, progressive visual analytics, which enable analysts to inspect partial results of an algorithm as they become available and interact with the algorithm to prioritize subspaces of interest.."
