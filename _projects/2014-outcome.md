description: "Patients' medical conditions often evolve in complex and seemingly unpredictable ways. Even within well-defined episodes of care, variations between patients' progression and outcome can be dramatic. We present a visual analytic system to support outcome analysis from retrospective clinical patient data. Our approach combines (1) visual queries to specify episodes, (2) pattern mining techniques to discover important events, and (3) interactive visualizations uncover event patterns that impact outcome and change over time."
