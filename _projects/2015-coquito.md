description: "Many researchers aim to analyze the behavior of cohorts whose behaviors are recorded in large event databases. However, extracting cohorts from databases is a difficult step, often overlooked. This is especially true when researchers wish to restrict their cohorts to exhibit a particular temporal pattern of interest. COQUITO is a visual interface that assists users defining cohorts with temporal constraints, designed to be comprehensible to domain experts with no preknowledge of database queries and also to encourage exploration."
