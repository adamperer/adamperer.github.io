description: "Frequence and Care Pathway Explorer are visual analytics system that integrates data mining and visualization for finding frequent patterns from longitudinal event sequences. They features novel frequent sequence mining algorithms to handle multiple levels-of-detail, temporal context, concurrency, and outcome analysis. Additionally, they also feature visual interfaces designed to support insights, and support exploration of patterns of the level-of-detail relevant to users."
