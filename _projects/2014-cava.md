description: "Cohort analysis is a widely used technique for the investigation of risk factors among clinical populations. However, this process is often constrained by a lack of integrated analytics and visualization. To address this challenge, we have designed CAVA, a platform for Cohort Analysis via Visual Analytics, which is designed to help domain experts work faster and more independently when performing retrospective cohort studies."
